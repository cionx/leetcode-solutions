/* Time: O(n)

/* Main observation: if the minimal difference is realized by two nodes, then it
 * cannot happen that one node is located in the left subtree while the other
 * node is located in the right subtree. Because otherwise, we could get an even
 * smaller difference by incorporating the root value.
 * We can therefore determine the minimal distance (recursively) as follows:
 *
 * 1. Determine the minimal difference in the left subtree.
 * 2. Determine the minimal difference in the right subtree.
 * 3. Determine the difference between the root value and the maximal value of
 *    the left subtree.
 * 4. Determine the difference between the root value and the minimal value of
 *    the right subtree.
 * 5. Take the minimum of all four differences.
 *
 * These steps lead to the following code.
