/* 189. Rotate Array */

/* Complexities.
 * Time: Î˜(n)
 * Space: O(min(k, n - k))
 * where n is the length of the input array and 0 <= k <= n. */

/* Idea.
 * We split the array into two parts: the head, consisting of n - k entries, and
 * the tail, consisting of k entries. We then swap the positions of the two
 * parts.
 *
 *  *---------------------*          *---------------------*
 *  |     head     | tail |   --->   | tail |     head     |
 *  *---------------------*          *---------------------*
 *
 * We will need some additional memory to prevent issues with overwriting. We
 * can move the larger part with memmove, which takes proper care of the
 * overlap. In this way, we only need to remember the smaller part. */
