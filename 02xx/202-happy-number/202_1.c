/* Note: a d-digit number has a happy value of at most 81 * d. Numbers with one
 * or two digits may grow larger at first, but already for three-digit numbers,
 * the maximal happy value is 243. Going downwards from 243, one can check that
 * by trial-and-error that 99 is the largest number whoâ€™s happy value is larger
 * than the number itself. In other words: for every start value n, we will
 * eventually land in the interval [1, 99].
 *
 * If we have been in this interval 100 times, then we know for sure that we
 * have repeated a value, and must therefore be trapped in a cycle. (We could
 * also use a more careful analysis: we could count the longest cycle one can
 * find in [1, 99], or do manual checks for specific values once the happy value
 * becomes small enough.)
